## Integration

#### Swift Package Manager

You can use [The Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) to install `swift-json` by adding the proper description to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.7
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/sutext/swift-kcp.git", from: "1.0.0"),
    ]
)
```
Then run `swift build` whenever you get prepared.
